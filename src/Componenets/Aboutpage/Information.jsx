                        In 1967, Ispahani Tea launched its first line of flavored teas, catering to the diverse tastes of its loyal 
                         customers. The new range of tea flavors included Mazedaar, Flowery Dust & Rani. The brand’s commitment to 
                          quality and taste remained unchanged, and the new flavors were met with enthusiastic response from customers 
                            across the country. With the launch of the new line of teas, Ispahani Tea continued to solidify its position 
                             as a leading tea brand in India. The brand’s dedication to providing customers with the highest quality 
                              tea, combined with a willingness to innovate and offer new and exciting flavors, has made Ispahani Tea a 
                                beloved brand for generations of tea drinkers.
